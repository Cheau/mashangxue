#### You look exited.
# I am. I just bought tickets for Maroon 5's [concert/n./3] in Tokyo in December.
#### I heard about their [concert tour/:巡回演唱会].
#### Aren't they coming to Taipei, too? Why didn't you buy their Taipei concert tickets?
# The Taipei concert tickets were [sold out/:售完] two hours after the tickets were [released/v./2] online.
# So I decided to try the Tokyo concerts instead.
#### I see. How much were the tickets?
# $200 USD for [floor seat/:地板座位] tickets.
#### That's a [decent/adj.] price. I paid $300 USD for Justin Bieber's concert last year.
#### Will you stay a few more days in Tokyo?
# I might. Maybe I'll take two days off work and spend more time in Tokyo.
#### You should. Tokyo is a fun city.
