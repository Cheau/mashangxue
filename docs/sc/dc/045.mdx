#### Yes. We can't go home empty-handed.
# I'm going to buy some [postcards:postcard/n.] for my colleagues at the office.
#### OK. What about [key chains:key chain/:钥匙圈] and [magnets:magnet/n.]?
# I think they are poorly made. And they aren't even made in France.
#### Good point. What about getting some French desserts?
# I would love to bring some macarons home, but they would dry out quickly.
#### We could get a few boxes of those cookies. The expiration date is two weeks from now.
# OK. Let's get four boxes.
#### What else? We could buy some dried [lavender sachets:lavender sachet/:薰衣草香氛袋].
#### The lavender is grown in Southern France and there is a buy 10 get 2 free promotion now.
# OK, let's get 20 sachets. Can we go now?
#### Give me 10 more minutes in the store.
# OK.
