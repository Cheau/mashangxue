# Do you have any pets?
## No, I don't. What about you?
# I have a dog. I [rescued/v.] him from the dog [shelter/n./2] three years ago.
He's five years old.
## what [breed/n.] is he?
# He's a Golden Retriever.
## That's nice. I would like a dog but my [landlord/n.] does not allow pets.
It's written in my apartment [lease/n./2].
# I'm sorry to hear that.
## That's OK. At least I save money by not buying dog food or paying vet bills.
# Maybe you can [dog-sit/v.] for me when I'm away this summer.
## Sure! I'd be happy to, as long as you're willing to pay.
