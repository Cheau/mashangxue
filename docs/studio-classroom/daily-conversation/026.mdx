# I need to buy a SIM card. Is there a [telecom/n./2] store in this mall?
#### Yes, there is, but it's in Building B. We're in Building A.
# How do I get to Building B?
#### You need to take the [skybridge/n.] on the third floor to get to Building B.
# How do I get to the skybridge?
#### Walk straight ahead, and you will see a set of [escalators/n./2]. Take the escalator to the second floor, then take another escalator to the third floor.
#### The skybridge is right beside the third floor escalators. Walk across the skybridge and you will see a big [supermarket/n.].
#### The telecom store is two doors down from the supermarket.
# Got it. Thanks for your help.
#### You're welcome. Have a nice day.
