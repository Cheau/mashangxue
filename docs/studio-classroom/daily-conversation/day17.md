# Hey Carol, what are you doing this weekend?
## I'm going [hiking/n.] with my husband and our hiking [club/n.].
# You have a hiking club?
## Yes, we do.
We have 30 to 40 people of all ages and [skill/n.] [levels:level/n./3].
# That's great.
Do you guys do day hikes or multi-day hikes?
## Mostly day hikes, but we do five or six multi-day hikes a year.
# Do you hike around the island or do you go [overseas:oversea] too?
## So far, our hikes are around the island.
Next year, we will do our first overseas hiking trip by doing a one-week hiking trip to Nepal.
# That sounds fun. I would love to join your hiking club.
## Sure, join us!
I'll send you our Facebook page and you'll see all our [upcoming/adj.] activities there.
# OK. Thanks!
