# 错过班机

# It's great to see you, Steve!
## Happy to see you Jack.
# How was your [flight]?
## The [process] was a [nightmare].
I'm just happy to be here now.
# What happened?
## I flew from Taipei to Tokyo, and then Tokyo to New York. 
[Due to] bad weather in Taipei, the plane was [grounded] for an hour.
I missed my [connection] in Tokyo because of the [delay].
Sky Air only has one flight a day to New York, so I spent an hour at Sky Air's [ticketing counter] as they tried to put me on another airline's flight.
# Sorry to hear that.
## Finally, they put me on  a Star Airlines flight for New York, but I had to wait for six hours in the airport.
# You must be [jet-lagged].
Let's go to the coffee shop next door and get you a cup of coffee.
## Sounds good. I sure need it.
