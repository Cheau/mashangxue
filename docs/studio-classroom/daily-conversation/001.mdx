# Why do you have a [Band-Aid/n.] on your face?
#### It's not a Band-Aid, it's an [acne/n.] [patch/n./8]. I have a big [pimple/n.] here, and I'm hoping the patch will make it go away faster.
# Oh, I haven't had acne problems since high school. In high school, I had really bad acne.
#### What did you do about it?
# I bought [over-the-counter/adj.] medicine at the pharmacy. When that didn't work, I saw a [dermatologist/n.] regularly and took [prescription/n./4] drugs.
#### Did it help?
# It helped some, but my acne only completely cleared after high school. Then I had to get [laser/n.] treatment to get rid of the acne [scars/n.].
#### Thanks for sharing. I won't [complain/v.] about a single pimple then!
