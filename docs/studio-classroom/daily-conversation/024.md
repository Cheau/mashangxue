## Hey Noah, what do you plan to do after you graduate from university?
# I'm going to the army.
## Army?
# Yes, we have [mandatory/n./2] basic [training/n./2] for four months.
It used to be 11 months, but it's been [shortened/v./5] for those born after 1993.
## I bet those four months will fly by quickly.
# I sure hope so. Once it's over I'll need to look for a job.
## I understand. I'll need to look for a job once I finish my six-month exchange program this summer.
# All the best to your job [search/n./2]!
## You too!
