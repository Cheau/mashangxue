# Do you have these hiking boots in size 8.5?
## The boots don't come in half sizes. So the next size after 8 is 9.
# I see. I'd like to try both sizes 8 and 9 then.
## OK. I'll be right back. How do they feel?
# Size 8 is too tight at the front. The shoes [pinch/v.] my feet.
## OK. Let's try size 9. How do they feel?
# They are more [comfortable/adj.]. But I'm not sure if they're too [loose/adj./4].
## Let me see. I can fit one finger between the [heel/n.] of your foot and the shoe.
This is the right size.
# OK. I'll take size 9 then.
## I'll ring it up at the cash register.
# Thanks.
