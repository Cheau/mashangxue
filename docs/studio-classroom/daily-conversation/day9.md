# Do you have any [pets]?
## No, I don't. What about you?
# I have a dog. I [rescued] him from the [dog shelter] three years ago.
He's five years old.
## what [breed] is he?
# He's a Golden Retriever.
## That's nice. I would like a dog but my [landlord] does not allow pets.
It's written in my apartment [lease].
# I'm sorry to hear that.
## That's OK. At least I save money by not buying dog food or paying [vet bills].
# Maybe you can [dog-sit] for me when I'm away this summer.
## Sure! I'd be happy to, [as long as] you're willing to pay.
