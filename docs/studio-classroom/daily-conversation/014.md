# Hi Sam, are you enjoying university?
## Yes, [sophomore/n.] year is much better than [freshman/n./2] year.
I made a new group of friends and joined several clubs.
# That's great to hear. What's your [major/n./2]?
## My major is Business Administration, with a [minor/n./2] in French.
# That must keep you busy.
## Yes, the [workload/n.] is heavy, but I enjoy what I'm studying.
# That's good. Do you plan to [graduate/n.] in four years?
## I plan to graduate in five years because I hope to do a one-year exchange program in France.
# That sounds exciting. All the best.
## Thanks!
