# Excuse me. Do you have this [sweater/n.] in M?
## Give me a minute. I'll check our computer to see if we still have one in [stock/n.].
## That sweater comes in black and red. We only have the red one in M.
# I prefer black.
## Let me check if our other [locations/n.] have the black one in M.
## Our Smith Street store has the black one in M.
Would you like me to have them send it here?
It would take 3 days to get here.
# That would be great.
## Please fill out this form, and you can come pick it up after Friday.
# OK. Thank you. Bye.
