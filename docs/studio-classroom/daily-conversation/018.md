# Did you feel the [earthquake/n.] last night?
## Yes, it was a big one.
I was sitting on the couch watching TV, and the couch started to shake.
What were you doing?
# I was taking a shower.
I wrapped myself in a towel, and ran out of the bathroom.
## That must have been scary!
# For sure. I checked the news.
The government said the earthquake was 4.9 on the Richter [scale/n./2], and its [epicenter/n.] was off the coast of Hualian.
## Wow, that's a big one!
I'm glad nobody got hurt, and no buildings [collapsed:collapse/v.].
# Me, too.
## Oh my!
Do you feel that?
# This must be an [aftershock/n.]. Stay calm, and let's get outside.
