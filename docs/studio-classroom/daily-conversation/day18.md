<dialog>
# Did you feel the [earthquake/n.] last night?
## Yes, it was a big one.
## I was sitting on the couch watching TV, and the couch started to shake.
## What were you doing?
# I was taking a shower.
# I wrapped myself in a towel, and ran out of the bathroom.
## That must have been scary!
# For sure.
# I checked the news.
# The government said the earthquake was 4.9 on the Richter [scale/n./2], and its [epicenter/n.] was off the coast of Hualian.
## Wow, that's a big one!
## I'm glad nobody got hurt, and no buildings [collapsed:collapse/v.].
# Me, too.
## On my!
## Do you feel that?
# This must be an [aftershock/n.].
# Stay calm, and let's get outside.
