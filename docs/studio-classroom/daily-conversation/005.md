# Wow, you're completely [soaked/v./1]!
## It's terrible out there. I had an umbrella but it was useless against the heavy rain.
# I can see that. Do you have a [change/n./3] of clothes?
## No, I don't.
# I have some extra clothes in my office.
I started keeping shirts and pants in the office after I got soaked in a [rainstorm/n.] last summer.
## What a great idea!
# We're about the same size. Let me get you a shirt and pants to change into.
## You're a [lifesaver/n./2]. Thanks!
# No worries. I'm happy to help. Make sure to check the [weather forecast/n.] next time.
## I will, and I will definitely keep extra closthes in the office.
