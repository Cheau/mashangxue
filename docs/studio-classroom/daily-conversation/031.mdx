#### I'd like to return this car.
# OK. I'll do a quick [inspection/n.] of the car.
# There is a small [dent/n.] on the passenger side door.
# I don't see this dent listed in the rental agreement.
#### I'm sorry. I have no idea how the dent got there. Is this [covered/adj./2] by the insurance I bought?
# Let me check. Yes, you have a [collision/n.] damage [waiver/n.]. That should cover the cost of fixing the dent.
# Please sign on the dotted line to confirm you returned the car.
#### OK.
# Thank you and have a nice day.
