# Hi Carla, I need to ask for [sick leave/n.] today. I caught a [nasty/adj./3] cold and woke up with a terrible headache this morning.
#### I understand. [Take care of/v.] yourself. Go see a doctor and pick up some medicine.
# I will. I will try to come in the office this afternoon if I feel better.
#### Take a sick day. Get well first before coming to the office, or you'll get us all sick.
# OK. Thanks. There's something I need help with. I need to do a sales [pitch/n./7] at Smith Technology at 4 p\.m\. this afternoon.
#### Don't worry. I'll have Charlie go in your place. Rest and get well soon.
# OK. Thank you, Carla. Bye.
