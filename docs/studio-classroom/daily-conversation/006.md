# It's raining heavily outside. Let's [order/v./4] in.
## That's a good idea.
# But we'll have to wait about 25 minutes to get our food.
## That's OK. I can wait.
# What do you feel like eating?
## How about Thai food?
# Sure. There's a Thai [restaurant/n.] on my food [delivery/n.] app.
It'll take about 30 minutes to get here.
## That's fine. I'd rather wait than [venture/v./1] out in the rain.
# Agree. Hmm... Do you order via food delivery apps often?
## I do. I don't cook, so when the weather is [lousy/adj.] like today, I usually just order in.
# I can understand. Food delivery apps are so [convenient/adj.] on days like this.
## Very.
